# 🏎️ Auto Race Math!

A fun math game built by a 7-year-old using voice prompts and AI — created with [Antigravity](https://antigravity.dev) and Claude.

## About

My son Gabriel (age 7) built this game to show his teacher. He described exactly what he wanted using voice prompts, and the AI helped him bring it to life — no keyboard required.

The game teaches **addition** using real sports car facts. Players compare two cars by adding their **Horsepower (HP)** and **Torque (TQ)** together to find the winner. Simple math, real cars, and a lot of fun.

## How to Play

1. Click **Let's Race! 🚦** to start
2. Two cars appear — each showing their HP and Torque stats
3. Add them together to find the **Total Power Score**
4. Click the car you think wins the race
5. See if you were right, and keep your streak going!

## Cars in the Game
